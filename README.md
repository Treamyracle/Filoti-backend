# Filoti - Lost and Found System

## About The Project

Filoti is a dedicated lost and found system developed to streamline and modernize the way lost items are reported and found items are announced within our faculty. This project was born out of the need to replace the current manual system that relies heavily on WhatsApp messages, which often gets mixed with other information and makes it difficult to track lost and found items effectively.

## Why Filoti?

- **Centralized System**: No more scrolling through numerous WhatsApp messages to find lost item announcements
- **Organized Information**: Dedicated platform for lost and found items only
- **Easy to Use**: Simple interface to report lost items or post found items
- **Better Tracking**: Keep track of all lost and found items in one place

## Vision

Our vision is to make the process of reporting and finding lost items as efficient as possible, helping our faculty members reconnect with their lost belongings quickly and easily.
